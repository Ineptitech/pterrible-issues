Pterrible is a one-of-a-kind bot for easily managing your game servers through Discord! It works with the Pterodactyl panel, so it supports a huge number of game hosting providers out of the box! We're currently running an open alpha of the bot, so continue to the Wiki to get started with it now!

## Development Status
This bot is under development and new features are being added consistently. We are always very open to suggestions and ideas. The bot is available to testers for free while it's still in development. Upon release, it will be available for a reasonable monthly subscription. Testers and contributors who provide us with valuable feedback during the alpha will get free or discounted lifetime access, at our discretion.
