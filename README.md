Pterrible is a one-of-a-kind bot for easily managing your game servers through Discord! It works with the Pterodactyl panel, so it supports a huge number of game hosting providers out of the box! We're currently running an open alpha of the bot, so [continue to the Wiki to get started](https://github.com/Ineptitech/pterrible-issues/wiki) with it now!

## Want Pterrible for free?
The bot is free to everyone while still in development! Testers and contributors who provide us with valuable feedback during the alpha will get free or discounted lifetime access upon release, at our discretion.
